# What do you know so far?

# EX1 - How to print:
# print("Hello World!")
# print("I'm printing contractions")

# EX2 - Comments:
# Comments are added with a #
# There aren't really block comments in Python
# just another # per line

# EX3 - Numbers and Math:
# Python can do math 
# Order of operations
# print("Count: ", 5 + 5 - 1 * 2)

# EX4 - Variables and Names
# Assigning variables using an = 
# Example: test = 200
# variable names should be lower case and a _ instead of a space

# EX5 - More Variables and Printing
# Variables still are assigned using =
# Format printing using f and {}
# Example: 
# phone = "iphone"
# print(f"My phone is an {phone}.")

# EX 6 - Strings and Text
# appending .format to the variable joke_evaluation and passing in hilarious prints 
# out False because of the empty brackets in joke_evaluation.
# example print(joke_evaluation.format(hilarious))
# joke_evaluation = "Isn't that joke so funny?! {}"

# EX 7 - More Printing
# .format('snow') adds snow where the {} exist
# print("." * 10) = prints . ten times
# use single quotes ' ' for short variables and double quotes " " for long variables
# \n adds a new line

# EX 8 - Printing, Printing
# We set the formatter variable to 4 {}
# We used .format to the variable formatter and passed in arguments 1,2,3,4
# It seems everytime .format is used it will need 4 arguments because of the {}
# Bool values don't need to be wrapped in " " but they do need to be capitalized

# EX 9 - Printing, Printing, Printing
# \n is a new line
# print("Some text here", variable)
# passing in the variable set prior
# print(""" """) prints everything inside the block """ """ or ''' '''

# EX 10 - What was that?
# \t adds a tab when printing the variable
# \n adds a new line ^ ^ ^
# \ is an escape character so you will need to double up \\ to escape a \ or 
# example: print("\"It\'s\" me")
